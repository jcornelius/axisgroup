                <h4>First:</h4>
                <p>We charge a $25,000 US retainer to begin the engagement. This includes a 2-day visit to your office anywhere in the EU to discuss the project, identify the first target market, begin crafting the value proposition, and outline the go to market approach. Then we will come back to the US, create an overview pitch deck for you in English and send it to you for review. We can stop when the deck is finalized, or we can continue to the next step if you wish.</p>
                <h4>Next:</h4> 
                <p>We continue the engagement at $5,000 US per month for a minimum of 3 months. We will actively send the deck to our network of companies and investors, hold meetings with them to answer questions and screen opportunities for you. Then we will set up meetings between you and any company with legitimate interest and which meets your criteria. After the initial 3 months this part of the engagement is renewed on a monthly basis, and you can cancel it at any time.</p>
                <h4>Last:</h4>
                <p>If we find a customer, partner, or investor &mdash; you are free to negotiate the terms of any deal on your own or we can remain engaged to assist with negotiations for 2% of the initial deal value.</p>
